# Instructions
1. Program in the assigned programming language (F #, Perl, Rust)
2. The programs are located in the (source_code) folder.
3. The code must be compiled on any operating system.
4. The code is uploaded at https://github.com/upslp-teoriacomputacional/matricula
5. Example. 00180864_sets. go
6. The program will be evaluated according to the rubric attached.
7. The evidence of the developed program is the template of the commented source code.
8. You can also show the operation of the programs in the beginning or term of class before the deadline.

## Rubric
---
#### Functionality:
The program works correctly and all the input variables are validated.
#### Logic reasoning:
It is a very refined compact code.
#### Code structuring:
If you use indentation, spaces and line spacing that gives greater clarity.
#### Documentation:
The presentation includes the name, surname, major, name of the specialty professor, name of the institution and enrollment, well-defined objectives documented and parts of the well-documented code.

### Writing Clear Code

The overarching goal when writing code is to make it easy to read and to understand. Well-written programs are easier to debug, easier to maintain, and have 
fewer errors. Writing a program is a lot like writing an essay. When writing an essay, your message is more convincing when it is accompanied by proper grammar and punctuation. When writing computer programs, you should follow the same principle. It is even more important when programming since someone may be assigned to maintain and support your code for long periods of time. You will appreciate the importance of good style when it is your task to understand and maintain someone else's code!
