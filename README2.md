##  Turing Machine
### (Last updated: 1-12-2020)
The objective of the programm is to generate a Turing machine to divide two numbers. 
  
  

#### understanding PDA:

To be completely honest. I had a lot of trouble writing this code. Couldn't find any valid example of how to use perl be able to make a completely usable turing machine, and due to the whole academic charge, homeworks, projects, etc. Couldn't make sure that what i did made any sense or if worked.

What made this difficult wasn't understanding a turing machine, it was understanding what a python dictionary even was or how to make something similar on perl. Even when the teacher explained a way to me. I still had trouble knowing what to do.
same thing with the map function. 


What i did was essentially try to do everything manually. Except it doesn't work with some tapes. I couldn't solve this, and i don't think i have enough time to try to implement a solution.

Since it's not entirely based on the one i was asked to base my work on, i don't know if its valid.
